# NodePiePy
NodePiePy is a Blender utility to quickly switch Editors or Worlds with the press of a button and mouse flick.
Aparently you can use the F# keys to do that, but I didn't know that when I wrote this, and I just like this better anyways.

Every Blender Version from 3.6 to 4.2 works!

## Setup:
- Install like any other addon.
- Add keybinds using `wm.call_menu` or `wm.call_menu_pie`.
- Set Name as `PIE_MT_world_switch` for world switcher or `VIEW3D_MT_PIE_fewindow_MT_fepie` for window switcher.

**Note I have my CapLock key mapped to F8 (I hate CapsLock)*
